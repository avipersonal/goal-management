# Goal Management

This application is used to track multiple goals in an easy-to-manage format. This application helps with goal tracking, the number of steps in a particular goal, the number of tasks, which tasks are in delay, and much more. It helps to see the exact number to understand where we are towards achieving our goal.

## Features

- **Three-level system** : It is in a three-hierarchy level (goal, success step, and Task) system, which helps in easily dividing the Goal into small, easy-to-accomplish tasks.
- **Delay tracking** : can track each task, success step, and goal delay to see the exact delay and help in finding out the root cause of the delay.
- **Grouping Related Goals** : You Can group related goals with the Parent goal to effectively see the heirarchy of short- and long-term goals.
- **Automation** : There is advanced business logic running behind the scenes to roll up all the necessary details from the grandchild to the parent. This will help you see up-to-date data.
